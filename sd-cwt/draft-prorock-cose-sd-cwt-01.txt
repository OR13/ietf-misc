1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   signature  The digital signature output.
   Claim Name  The human-readable name used to identify a claim.
   Claim Key  The CBOR map key used to identify a claim.
   Claim Value  The CBOR map value representing the value of the claim.
   CWT Claims Set  The CBOR map that contains the claims conveyed by the
      CWT.

3.  Selective disclosure of claims within a CWT

3.1.  Overview

   CBOR claims are cpommonly signed using COSE Sign1 (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9052#section-4.2) where only one signature is
   placed on a particular message.  There are many cases where a signer
   may wish to ensure that the authenticity of a message has not been
   compromised via a digital signature, but where they only wish to
   reveal some values of the original signed message.  This document

Internet-Draft                   sd-cwt                      August 2023


   outlines a precise method for formulating and transmitting these
   messages, encompassing elements such as claims, claim keys, and
   necessary data structures.  This kind of signed information exchange
   proves particularly beneficial in scenarios where a CBOR Web Token
   (CWT) might transit via an intermediary before undergoing third-party
   verification.  Frequently, such a third party might necessitate, or
   be permitted to access only a subset of the information encapsulated
   in the CWT.  This proposed model facilitates selective data
   disclosure, while still preserving the ability to validate the
   original signature.

   This representation relies on claims registered in the IANA CBOR Web
   Token (CWT) Claims Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/cwt/
   cwt.xhtml) whenever possible.

3.3.  Creating an SD-CWT

   An SD-CWT is a CWT containing the hash digests of the claim values
   combined with unique random salts and additional metadata for
   disclosed values.  The SD-CWT MUST be digitally signed using the
   issuer's private key.

   SD-CWT-CLAIMS = (METADATA, CWT-CLAIMS)
   SD-CWT = SD-CWT-CLAIMS | SIG(SD-CWT-CLAIMS, ISSUER-PRIV-KEY)

   CWT-CLAIMS is an object where claim names are mapped to hash digests
   of the claim values combined with unique random salts:

   CWT-CLAIMS = (
       CLAIM-NAME: HASH(SALT | CLAIM-VALUE)
   )*

   In a case where an SD-CWT is sent with all information disclosed, the
   SD-CWT is sent together with the mapping of the plain-text claim
   values, the salt values, and potentially some other information.  In
   this case, the the payload contains the CWT-CLAIMS, and the
   "disclosures" field in the unprotected header contains the mapping,
   the salt values, and any additional metadata that might be present in
   the unprotected header.

   In a case where an SD-CWT is sent with only selected information
   disclosed, only the disclosed claims, mappings, and salts are added
   to the disclosure.

   Disclosures are structured as a "claim-pair" with a 32 bit salt, and
   the byte string of the disclosed value.

   claim-pair = {
     1 => uint .size 4,  ; 32-bit salt
     2 => bstr           ; disclosed value
   }

   The CDDL fragment that represents the above text for COSE_Sign1 is
   provided below:

   SD-CWT = [
       protected,
       unprotected: {
         ? disclosures: [* claim-pair] / nil
       },
       payload : bstr / nil,
       signature : bstr,
   ]

Internet-Draft                   sd-cwt                      August 2023


   The issuer SHOULD take appropriate percautions to verify that the
   salts are unique random values to prevent vulnerability to rainbow
   table attacks against the hashes.

3.4.  Verifying an SD-CWT

   To verify an SD-CWT, the recipient extracts the protected CWT claims
   from the payload.  These CWT claims contain hash digests of the
   original claim values combined with unique random salts.

   The recipient MUST validate that the protected header values such as
   issuer, audience, and expiration match the expected values for this
   SD-CWT per the guidelines set forward in [RFC8392].  If any items do
   not match the expected or allowed values per [RFC8392] the SD-CWT
   MUST be rejected.

   The payload and other protected claims MUST then be validated
   according to the section "Validating a CWT" in [RFC8392].  If the CWT
   is not a COSE_Sign or COSE_Sign1 the CWT MUST be rejected.  If any
   validations according [RFC9052] instructions for validating a
   COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object fail, the CWT MUST be rejected.

   The recipient that checks for any disclosures in the unprotected
   header.  If they are present, the the claim values and salts MUST be
   extracted from the unprotected header.

   For each disclosed claim, the hash digest MUST be recomputed from the
   value and salt in the unprotected header.  If the hash digest does
   not equal the corresponding digest in the payload the SD-CWT MUST be
   rejected.

   By performing these steps, the recipient can cryptographically verify
   the integrity of the protected claims and verify they have not been
   tampered with or substituted after issuance by the trusted issuer.
   The disclosures provide the plaintext claim values for utilization by
   the recipient.

3.5.  Holder Binding and other common scenarios

3.5.1.  Holder Binding

   Holder binding links an SD-CWT to its intended recipient.  It
   prevents misuse if the token is intercepted or stolen.  Binding
   mechanisms include cryptographic key confirmation, biometric data
   inclusion, or embedding holder-specific claims.  The description of
   exact mechanisms for holder binding are outside the scope of this
   document at the present time.

Internet-Draft                   sd-cwt                      August 2023


   While optional, holder binding enhances SD-CWT security.  It enables
   accountability by auditing actions to specific entities.  For
   sensitive data, it augments trust by proving the claimant owns the
   token.

   Issuers should assess their use case when considering holder binding.
   Where accountability and non-repudiation are critical, binding
   provides assurance the token reaches the intended holder.  With
   thoughtful implementation, binding can customize SD-CWT without
   compromising user privacy.  Proportional use of holder binding
   balances security, privacy and flexibility for SD-CWT applications.

3.5.2.  Counter Signatures

   Counter signatures allow an SD-CWT to be endorsed by additional
   entities beyond the original issuer.  The counter signature is
   applied in the unprotected header, attesting to the validity of the
   primary SD-CWT signature over the protected claims.

   Counter signatures provide multiple benefits for SD-CWT:

   *  Verification by multiple entities, preventing repudiation by any
      one party.
   *  Added integrity protection in case the original signing key is
      compromised.
   *  Allows separate signers for protected claims versus unprotected
      disclosures.

   To utilize a counter signature, the primary SD-CWT is constructed and
   signed as normal.  Then an additional signer computes the counter
   signature over the entire SD-CWT, including the original signature.
   This counter signature is placed in the unprotected header when
   transmitting the SD-CWT.

   Recipients validate the counter signature after verifying the primary
   signature, ensuring endorsements by all involved entities.  Care
   should be taken to ensure robust trust in both signature authorities
   when relying on counter signatures.

4.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations from COSE [RFC9052] and CWT [RFC8392]
   SHOULD be followed.

   To maintain the integrity of the issued claims, the Selective
   Disclosure-CBOR Web Token (SD-CWT) MUST be signed by the issuer.
   Absence of this signature leaves the SD-CWT vulnerable to attackers,
   who can alter or append claims (for instance, modifying the "email"
   attribute to hijack the victim's account or inserting a fabricated
   academic qualification).

   The verifier is required to verify the signature on the SD-CWT to
   guarantee its authenticity and that no tampering has occurred post
   issuance.  If the signature on the SD-CWT fails the verification
   process, the SD-CWT MUST be unequivocally rejected.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Media Type Registration

   This section will register the "application/sd-cwt" media type
   [RFC2046] in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes] in the
   manner described in RFC 6838 [RFC6838], which can be used to indicate
   that the content is a CWT.

   *  Subtype name: sd-cwt
   *  Required parameters: n/a
   *  Optional parameters: n/a
   *  Encoding considerations: binary
