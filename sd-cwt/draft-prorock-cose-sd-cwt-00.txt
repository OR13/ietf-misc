1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   signature  The digital signature output.
   Claim Name  The human-readable name used to identify a claim.
   Claim Key  The CBOR map key used to identify a claim.
   Claim Value  The CBOR map value representing the value of the claim.
   CWT Claims Set  The CBOR map that contains the claims conveyed by the
      CWT.

3.  Selective disclosure of claims within a CWT

3.1.  Overview

   CBOR claims are cpommonly signed using COSE Sign1 (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9052#section-4.2) where only one signature is
   placed on a particular message.  There are many cases where a signer
   may wish to ensure that the authenticity of a message has not been
   compromised via a digital signature, but where they only wish to
   reveal some values of the original signed message.  This document

Internet-Draft                   sd-cwt                      August 2023


   outlines a precise method for formulating and transmitting these
   messages, encompassing elements such as claims, claim keys, and
   necessary data structures.  This kind of signed information exchange
   proves particularly beneficial in scenarios where a CBOR Web Token
   (CWT) might transit via an intermediary before undergoing third-party
   verification.  Frequently, such a third party might necessitate, or
   be permitted to access only a subset of the information encapsulated
   in the CWT.  This proposed model facilitates selective data
   disclosure, while still preserving the ability to validate the
   original signature.

   This representation relies on claims registered in the IANA CBOR Web
   Token (CWT) Claims Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/cwt/
   cwt.xhtml) whenever possible.

3.3.  Creating an SD-CWT

   An SD-CWT is a CWT of the hash digests of the claim values with
   unique random salts and other metadata.  It MUST be digitally signed
   using the issuer's private key.

   SD-CWT-CLAIMS = (METADATA, CWT-CLAIMS)
   SD-CWT = SD-CWT-CLAIMS | SIG(SD-CWT-CLAIMS, ISSUER-PRIV-KEY)

   CWT-CLAIMS is a simple object with claim names mapped to hash digests
   over the claim values with unique random salts:

   CWT-CLAIMS = (
       CLAIM-NAME: HASH(SALT | CLAIM-VALUE)
   )*

   In a case where an SD-CWT is sent with all information disclose, the
   SD-CWT is sent together with the mapping of the plain-text claim
   values, the salt values, and potentially some other information.  In
   this case, the the payload contains the CWT-CLAIMS, and the field
   "disclosures" contains the mapping, the salt values, and other
   metadata.

   In a case where an SD-CWT is sent with only some information
   discosed, only the desired claims, mappings, and salts are added to
   the disclosure.

   The CDDL fragment that represents the above text for COSE_Sign1
   follows.

   SD-CWT = [
       Headers,
       payload : bstr / nil,
       signature : bstr,
       disclosures: bstr / nil
   ]

3.5.2.  Counter Signatures

   TBD- Discuss use with countersignatures in the unprotected header

3.6.  Data Structures

   TBD - Describe common data structures in CDDL

3.7.  Examples

   TBD - Provide examples

4.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations from COSE [RFC8152] and CWT [RFC8392]
   SHOULD be followed.

   To maintain the integrity of the issued claims, the Selective
   Disclosure-CBOR Web Token (SD-CWT) MUST be signed by the issuer.
   Absence of this signature leaves the SD-CWT vulnerable to attackers,
   who can alter or append claims (for instance, modifying the "email"
   attribute to hijack the victim's account or inserting a fabricated
   academic qualification).

   The verifier is required to verify the signature on the SD-CWT to
   guarantee its authenticity and that no tampering has occurred post
   issuance.  If the signature on the SD-CWT fails the verification
   process, the SD-CWT MUST be unequivocally rejected.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Media Type Registration

   This section will register the "application/sd-cwt" media type
   [RFC2046] in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes] in the
   manner described in RFC 6838 [RFC6838], which can be used to indicate
   that the content is a CWT.

   *  Type name: application
   *  Subtype name: sd-cwt
   *  Required parameters: n/a
   *  Optional parameters: n/a
   *  Encoding considerations: binary
   *  Security considerations: See the Security Considerations section
      of [RFC8392]
