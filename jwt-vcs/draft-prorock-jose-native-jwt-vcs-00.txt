          Native JWT Representation of Verifiable Credentials
                  draft-prorock-jose-native-jwt-vcs-00

Abstract

   This document describes how to construct and utilize a JWT as a
   Verifiable Credential utilizing only JSON and registered claims.

   This document does not define any new cryptography, only
   seralizations of systems.

1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   signature  The digital signature output.

3.  Native JWT Representation of Verifiable Credentials

3.1.  Overview

   This section provides guidance on how to use JSON [RFC8259] claimsets
   with JWT [RFC7519] registered claims to construct a JWT that can be
   mapped to a verifiable credential.  This section also describes how
   to use content types and token types to distinguish different
   representations of verifiable credentials.

   This representation relies on claims registered in the IANA JSON Web
   Token Claims Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/
   jwt.xhtml#claims) whenever possible.

   Implementers using this representation SHOULD NOT use vc+ld+json as
   an input.

3.1.1.  Credential Header

   typ MUST use the media type vc+jwt.

   Example of credential metadata (decoded JWT header):

   {
     "kid": "https://example.edu/issuers/14#key-0",
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "vc+jwt"
   }

3.1.2.  Credential

   Example of a credential (decoded JWT payload):

   {
     "iss": "https://example.edu/issuers/14",
     "sub": "1234567890",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "iat": 1516239022,
     "urn:example:claim": true
   }

   NOTE: The vc and vp claims MUST NOT be present when the content type
   header parameter is set to credential-claims-set+json.

3.1.3.  Verifiable Credential

   Example of an JWT encoded verifiable credential (using external
   proof):

4.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations from JSON [RFC8259] and JWT [RFC7519]
   SHOULD be followed.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Media Type Registration

   This section will register the "application/vc+jwt" media type
   [RFC2046] in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes] in the
   manner described in RFC 6838 [RFC6838], which can be used to indicate
   that the content is a JWT.

   *  Type name: application
   *  Subtype name: vc+jwt
   *  Required parameters: n/a
   *  Optional parameters: n/a
   *  Encoding considerations: 8bit; JWT values are encoded as a series
      of base64url-encoded values (some of which may be the empty
      string) separated by period ('.') characters.
   *  Security considerations: See the Security Considerations section
      of RFC 7519
   *  Interoperability considerations: n/a
   *  Published specification: n/a
   *  Applications that use this media type: OpenID Connect, Mozilla
   *  Persona, Salesforce, Google, Android, Windows Azure, Amazon Web
   *  Services, and numerous others
   *  Fragment identifier considerations: n/a
   *  Additional information: Magic number(s): n/a File extension(s): n/
      a Macintosh file type code(s): n/a
   *  Person & email address to contact for further information: Michael
      Prorock, mprorock@mesur.io
   *  Intended usage: COMMON
   *  Restrictions on usage: none
   *  Author: Michael Prorock, mprorock@mesur.io
   *  Change controller: IESG
   *  Provisional registration?  Yes
